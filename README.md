# RESUME GENERATOR

<p align="center"><img src="./src/screenshots/logo.jpg"  width="50%" ></p>

This web application is used to generate and download the resume for the user after he/she fills in the details in the forms. This application is best for one who needs a resume in a short time or for one who doesn't have an idea of creating one. I developed this application while I was learning the concepts of state management in `react` using the `redux-toolkit`.
