# RESUME GENERATOR

<p align="center"><img src="./src/screenshots/logo.jpg"  width="50%" ></p>

This web application is used to generate and download the resume for user after he/she fills the details in the forms. This application is best for the one who need resume in short time or to the one who don't have idea of creating. I developed this application while I am learning the concepts of state management in `react` using the `redux-toolkit`.
